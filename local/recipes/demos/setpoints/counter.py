Description:

This demo illustrates creating a `Setpoint` named
`counter` that increments itself forever in an 
infinite while loop. 

The counter value can be modified from the Aqueduct
user interface.

This is a simple example, but it illustrates the general
process of creating an externally modifiable value 
that can be used in your Recipe logic.
